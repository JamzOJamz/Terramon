             These are also used as DVs, or determinant values, in Gens

             In Gen 2-6, these must match the Hidden Power type.
            
             In Gen 7+, Bottle Caps means these can either match the
             Hidden Power type or 31.

             has no direct competitive effects, but has implications for
             event legality. For example, any Rayquaza that knows V-Create
             must be sent out from a Cherish Ball.
            
             TODO: actually support this in the validator, switching animations,
             and the teambuilder.
